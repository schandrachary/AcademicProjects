This is a circular buffer implementation using queue data structure. The length of the buffer is assigned 
5 here, but it can be changed to any length using the `#define` macro. Watch a quick [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGxIiQ58BoE&feature=youtu.be) that demostrates the buffer in action.
